# MineKhan
	Name: MineKhan v3.7.7 (Unofficial)
	Coding Difficulty: It started out hard, but got easier as time pasted and I got more familiar with this program.
	Date Started: Unknown (Sometime between August and October of 2021)
	Date Finished: Tuesday, July 18th, 2023
	Creator: The original MineKhan was created by Willard, but this spin-off was created by Ninja Programming
	Lines of Code: 12,602
	Number of Characters (Including Spaces): 510,559
	Version: Alpha 3.7.7
	Program Link: https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5025491787235328
	About: I first made a spin-off of Willard's MineKhan on this account, just to build a world. But then, I started to look through all of the spin-offs of MineKhan, and I began to see that some of them had some really cool new features. And so, I began to wonder if it would be possible to combine most (if not all) of those features into one program (plus, I wanted to try to make the scenes a little nicer, like the menu, the inventory, and the world settings menu).

	First of all, I want to list all of the original creators of the code that I used from other MineKhan spin-offs:
	
	Okay, so first of all, I got all of the new blocks in this program from ItzBB_sarahðŸŒ¹'s (@S5a0r0ah) spin-off of MineKhan, titled Town w/ more blocks, Terry Harpy 2's (@CoolGuy770) spin-off of MineKhan, titled A Dark Ages Village (with more blocks), josh (back)'s (@cococococute) spin-off of MineKhan, titled MineKhan, and two of Velociraptor105's (@Velociraptor105) spin-offs of MineKhan, one titled Minekhan 2 Workspace, and the other titled \/ MineKhan 2. If I think of any more programs that I used blocks from, I'll add them to this list.

	The next programer that I want to give credit to is S ðŸ‡³ ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡µ ðŸ‡¾ (@somebudyelse).  From S ðŸ‡³ ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡µ ðŸ‡¾'s spin-off of MineKhan, titled 'MineKhan 0.8.1 concept WITH WOODEN TRAPDOORS' I used, well actually I began this program by making a spin-off of MineKhan, and then copying all of the code from MineKhan 0.8.1 concept WITH WOODEN TRAPDOORS, so technically this is both a spin-off of MineKhan, and a spin-off of 'MineKhan 0.8.1 concept WITH WOODEN TRAPDOORS'.

	The programmer thingMaker (@at45290) was the original creator of the jungle setting (which by the way, I think is vary cool!)
	thingMaker also first created the Big Trees setting, I just modified it a bit.
	thingMaker also originally created the 'Stair Corner Out' and 'Stair Corner In' block types.
	The animated blocks also came from thingMaker (I didn't use all of the animated blocks that thingMaker made in his MineKhan spin-off 'Animated fire' (URL: https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/Animated Fire/5786915429203968). At first, I tried adding all of the animated blocks, but in the end, the program crashed when I tried to add the animated fire and water, so I just used the animated blocks block and the animated ore block.)
	Additionally, thingMaker created the code for the structures setting. I just changed the original structures to basic houses.

	I used code from the programmer Velociraptor105 (@Velociraptor105) to create the feature where each tree generated has a specific leaf block (all the oak trees have oak leaves, all the birch trees have birch leaves, etc.). but to add that feature, I had to find these special leaves, and I found them on one of Velociraptor105' spin-offs of MineKhan as well.
	Also from Velociraptor105, I got the code for the different block shapes, as well as the flowers setting (I made the actual setting, but Velociraptor105 made the code that makes flowers load with the rest of the world, like the trees.).
	Velociraptor105 also originally created the 'swimming' function (so that when you are in a lake, you can 'swim' up and down, as well as front, back left, and right, by using the space and shift keys, like you would do if you were flying).

	Another programmer that I would like to give credit to is Aragorn Elessar (@AmericanGuard). Aragorn Elessar originally created the blocks 'Warrior #1' and 'Warrior #2'. You can find all of the blocks that Aragorn Elessar created at: https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/MineKhan + More Block Designs & Shapes!/4547490303229952

	And last, but not least, I'd like to give credit to Willard (@willllard), since he made the original MineKhan Program (and this program would not exist if Willard had not made the original MineKhan).
